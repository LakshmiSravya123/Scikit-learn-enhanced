Enhanced Performance Guide
==========================

This guide covers the performance enhancements in scikit-learn enhanced.

Memory Management
-----------------

The enhanced version includes custom memory pool allocators that reduce
allocation overhead and improve cache performance.

GPU Acceleration
----------------

GPU acceleration is available for supported algorithms when CUDA or OpenCL
is available on the system.

SIMD Optimization
-----------------

Hand-optimized SIMD kernels provide significant speedups for numerical
computations on modern CPUs.
