**Enhanced K-Means with Triangle Inequality and SIMD** - :class:`sklearn.cluster`

Added :class:`sklearn.cluster._kmeans_enhanced` with advanced clustering optimizations:

- Triangle inequality bounds for distance computation acceleration
- SIMD-optimized distance calculations using AVX2 instructions
- Enhanced K-means++ initialization with smart sampling
- Parallel processing with dynamic load balancing

These improvements provide 2-4x speedup for K-means clustering while maintaining identical results.
